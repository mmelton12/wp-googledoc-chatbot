+# WordPress Google Doc Q&A with Pinecone and OpenAI!
+
+## Overview
+
+This WordPress plugin allows users to ask questions about the content of a Google Doc. The plugin leverages a Python Flask service that interacts with Pinecone and OpenAI to provide relevant answers.  The Google Doc is processed, embedded into Pinecone, and then queried using OpenAI's language models to generate insightful responses. 
+
+## Prerequisites
+
+* **Server-side:**
+    * PHP (compatible with your WordPress installation)
+    * Python 3.7+
+    * Flask
+    * Pinecone Python Client
+    * OpenAI Python Client
+    * NLTK
+* **Client-side:**
+    * WordPress (compatible with the plugin)
+* **Services:**
+    * Pinecone account and API key
+    * OpenAI account and API key
+    * Google Cloud Project with the Google Docs API enabled
+
+## Installation
+
+**1. Plugin Installation:**
+
+* Download the plugin ZIP file.
+* Upload the plugin to your WordPress site through the **Plugins > Add New** menu.
+* Activate the plugin.
+
+**2. Python Service Installation:**
+
+* Clone the Python service repository.
+* Navigate to the repository directory.
+* Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
+* Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
+* Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
+
+## Configuration
+
+**1. Plugin Settings:**
+
+* Navigate to the plugin settings page in your WordPress admin panel.
+* Provide the URL of your Flask service.
+* Enter your Google Cloud Project ID.
+* Configure any other plugin-specific settings.
+
+**2. Python Service Configuration:**
+
+* **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Python service and add the following:
+    ```
+    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
+    PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment
+    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
+    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/google_credentials.json" 
+    ```
+* **Database Setup:** Follow the instructions provided in the Python service documentation to set up the database for storing document metadata (if applicable).
+
+**Security Note:** Never hardcode API keys directly in your code. Use environment variables or secure configuration methods.
+
+## Usage
+
+1. **Connect Google Doc:**  In the plugin settings, authorize the plugin to access your Google Drive and select the desired Google Doc.
+2. **Index Document:** Use the plugin's interface to index the content of the Google Doc into Pinecone. This process creates vector embeddings of the document's text.
+3. **Ask Questions:** A search bar or designated area will be provided on your website (using a shortcode or widget). Users can enter their questions related to the Google Doc.
+4. **Get Answers:** The plugin sends the query to the Flask service, which retrieves relevant information from Pinecone and uses OpenAI to generate an answer. The answer is then displayed to the user.
+
+## Troubleshooting
+
+* **Connection Errors:** Verify that your Flask service is running and accessible from your WordPress server. Check firewall settings if necessary.
+* **API Issues:** Ensure that your API keys for Pinecone and OpenAI are correct and have the necessary permissions.
+* **Indexing Problems:** Make sure the Google Doc is accessible and that the plugin has the required permissions to read its content.
+* **No Results:** If the answers are irrelevant or no results are found, consider adjusting the Pinecone index settings or refining the way questions are formulated.
